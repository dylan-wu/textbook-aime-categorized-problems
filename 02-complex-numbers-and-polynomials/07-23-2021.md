### 1983 AIME Problem 5

$x=a+bi$

$y=c+di$

$(a+bi)^2+(c+di)^2=7$

$(a+bi)^3+(c+di)^3=10$

First step is to write it out in a different way, ditch the complex numbers

$(x+y)^2-2xy=7$ and $x^3+y^3=(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)=(7-xy)(x+y)=10$

Write it in such a way so that you can substitute the squares part into the cubes part.

Then, we can use a second substitution of $w$ and $z$ where $w=x+y$ and $z=xy$

This reduces the equations to $w^2-2z=7$ and $w(7-z)=10$.

We want the largest possible $w$? Why? That part doesn't make sense at all. Isn't a complex number $a+bi$? So then $w=x+y$, then $x+y$ still results in a complex number. Same with $z$, since $z=xy$, $(a+bi)(c+di)$ still results in a complex number. So neither of these has only real values.

$P_0(x)=x^3+313x^2-77x-8$. For integers $n\ge1$, define $P_n(x)=P_{n-1}(x-n)$. Then what is the coefficient of $x$ in $P_{20}(x)$

$P_1(x)=(x-1)^3+313(x-1)^2-77(x-1)-8$

$P_2(x)=(x-1-2)^3+313(x-1-2)^2-77(x-1-2)-8$

$P_{20}(x)=(x-(20+19+18+17+16+...+1))^3+313(x-(20+19+18+17+16+...+1))^2-77(x-(20+19+18+17+16+...+1))-8$

$20+9(20)+10=210$

$(x-210)^3+313(x-210)^2-77(x-210)-8$
