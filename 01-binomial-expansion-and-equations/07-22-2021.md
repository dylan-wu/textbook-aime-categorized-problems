### 1986 AIME Problem 2

Rewrite the original expression in terms of $x,y,z$

So we have $(x,y,z)=(\sqrt{5},\sqrt{6},\sqrt{7}),(x^2,y^2,z^2)=(5,6,7)$

Key thing is difference of squares, seems like they really do just multiply the whole thing out?

I thought there might be a smarter way to do it.

### 1991 AIME Problem 1

$xy+x+y=71$

$x^2y+xy^2=880$

Find $x^2+y^2$

Define $a=x+y$ and $b=xy$ and substitute.

$a+b=71$

$ab=880$

What happens if we solve for $a$ and $b$?

$a=\frac{880}{b}$

$\frac{880}{b}+b=71$
